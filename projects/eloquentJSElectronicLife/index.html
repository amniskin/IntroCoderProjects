    <project-intro>
    <p>In this project we'll be continuing the game from <a href='http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_elife.html'>Eloquent JavaScipt</a> called Electronic Life. If you have not yet checked out Elequent JavaScript, start <a href='http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html'>here</a>. Read that section and then do the project in the next section. I cannot stress the benefits of reading the section before starting the project enough as his explanations are excellent. Once you've finished that project, come here and we'll make a decent looking GUI (Graphical User Interface) for our program.</p>

    <project-step title="Animating the world">
      <p>When writing the project on the Eloquent JavaScript website, we didn't really have to worry about the animation part of things; that is because the author wrote the <code>animateWorld</code> for us. Well, since we're no longer working with his version, we're going to have to write this function ourselves. Luckily, this is not a very difficult task. The key thing is a JavaScript function called <code>setTimeout</code>.</p>
      <p>The <code>setTimeout</code> function takes two arguments, a function to run and a duration of how long to wait before running it. What function do you think we should run? Try to figure out how to use <code>setTimeout</code> to write our <code>animateWorld</code> function. Remember, <code>animateWorld</code> needs to take a "world" as an argument, make the world "take a turn" (whatever that may mean for this world), and display the result of this turn (for which we have been using <code>console.log(world.toString())</code> so far).</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>function animateWorld(world) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    world.turn();
    console.log(world.toString());
    animateWorld(world);
  }, 500);
}</pre>
      <p>You may notice that we call the <code>animateWorld</code> function from within its very own definition. This is called "recursion" and it is a very useful tool in a programmer's toolbox. The basic idea here is that when the function is called, it will call itself again. That is why the turns keep on happening. Let's walk through this evaluation once...</p>
      <ul>The function is called, and evaluates to
        <li>
          <pre>wait 500 miliseconds then, 
  world.turn();
  console.log(world.toString());
  animateWorld(world);</pre>
        </li>
        <li style= "list-style:none;">==></li>
        <li>
          <pre>wait 500 miliseconds then, 
  world.turn();
  console.log(world.toString());
  wait 500 miliseconds then, 
    world.turn();
    console.log(world.toString());
    animateWorld(world);
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li style= "list-style:none;">==></li>
        <li>
          <pre>wait 500 miliseconds then, 
  world.turn();
  console.log(world.toString());
  wait 500 miliseconds then, 
    world.turn();
    console.log(world.toString());
    wait 500 miliseconds then, 
      world.turn();
      console.log(world.toString());
      animateWorld(world);
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>and so on... But we see that the recursive call really just makes the program call the function every 500 miliseconds, which is exactly what we want!</p>
    </project-step>
    <project-step title="Gettin griddy with it">
      <p>Let's use our trusty friends over at <a href='http://getbootstrap.com'>bootstrap</a> to help us with our grid. Their grid system is a 12 column grid system, but does it have to be? I mean, it would behove us to have a much larger grid system. Granted, we could use columns within columns to achieve our goal, but it would be so much nicer if the grid system had as many columns as our game grid does. First, let's find out how many columns are in our game (this project will be using the tigers and herbavores version from one of the exercises at the end of the project). So go ahead and find out the grid width now.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>worldName.gird.width
==> 52</pre>
      <p>Now that we know how many columns we would like our grid to have, let's get a version of bootstrap with that number of columns. Try and figure out how to do that on the bootstrap webpage. Remember that we only want the grid from them. Nothing more. And don't forget to link the file in our HTML.</p>
      <div class='hint blur'><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/customize/'>http://getbootstrap.com/customize/</a>
        <p>In the checklist on the top (where it says "less files" and the second one that says "jQuery plugins"), make sure you uncheck all except the grid system.</p>
        <p>Next, go down to the grid system section <a href='http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#grid-system'>here</a>, and set the number of columns to 52 and the grid-gutter-width to 0px (so it looks good on mobile devices). Then click "compile and download" on the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p>Once you've done that, move the bootstrap.min.css file to within your project's directory and make sure to link css file in your HTML</p>
      </div>
    </project-step>
    <project-step title="Making our grid">
      <p>Now, we could hand-code this game board. We could go through, row by row, cell by cell, making each piece and giving each piece the correct class names and everything, but I don't know if you realized... There are over 500 cells and 12 rows. That's a whole lot of cells that I don't really feel like coding by hand. Luckily, we can use javascript and jQuery to help us with this (yes, it can be done without jQuery, but why would I want to do that?).</p>
      <p>First, let's make a div for us to put the gameboard in. We could just append the gameboard to the <code>body</code>, but I think it's nicer if we do it this way. that way we can have multiple games later on and not have to refactor any code. So, we are probably going to want to give this div some sort of identifying attribute. In my case, I know I'm only going to want one thing on this page, so I am just using the div with class "container-fluid" as my board container. I can call it by using <code>$(".container-fluid")</code>.</p>
      <p>Next, let's make a function named "makeBoard" that takes a "world" object as its argument. This function will eventually return the gameBoard jQuery DOM element.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>function makeBoard(world) {
}</pre>
      <p>Next, let's store some useful values as variables like, the world's width and height, and the jQuery DOM element that we want to put the grid in and return.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>var width  = world.grid.width,
    height = world.grid.height,
    board  = $("&#60;div class='gameBoard'>");</pre>
      <p>Now let's make a function that given two numbers, i and j, returns a jQuery DOM element that is a cell at row i and column j. This cell should have an ID that is descriptive of which cell it is (row and column are good cell identifiers). In my version, a cell in row 2 and column 5 would have id "2-5". I suggest doing that.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>function makeCell(i, j) {
  return $("&#60;div class='col-xs-1' id='" + i + "-" + "'>");
}</pre>
      <p>Great! Now let's make a function that given a number, i, returns the ith row! I think it would be nice if the rows had IDs too. Remember, the rows contain cells, so you'll have to call the <code>makeCell</code> function from within this function definition, but how?</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>function makeRow(i) {
  var row = $("&#60;div class='row' id='" + i + "'>");
  for (var j = 0; j &#60; width; j++) {
    row.append(makeCell(i, j));
  }
  return row;
}</pre>
      <p>Great! Now that function returns complete rows! All that's left to do is fill in all the rows in our game board before we return it!</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>for (var i = 0; i &#60; height; i++) {
  board.append(makeRow(i));
}

return board;</pre>
      <p>Now if we want to make a grid, we can just call:</p>
      <pre>$('boardContainerIdentifier').html(makeBoard(worldName));</pre>
      <div class='hint blur'>
        <p>It's good form to have the <code>makeRow</code> and <code>makeCell</code> functions within the scope of the larger <code>makeBoard</code> function like so:</p>
        <pre>function makeBoard(world) {
  var board  = $("&#60;div class='gameBoard'>"),
      width  = world.grid.width,
      height = world.grid.height;
  function makeCell(i, j) {
    return $("&#60;div class='col-xs-1' id='" + i + "-" + j + "'>");
  }
  function makeRow(i) {
    var row = $("&#60;div class='row' id='" + i + "'>");
    for (var j = 0; j &#60; width; j++) {
      row.append(makeCell(i, j));
    }
    return row;
  }
  for (var i = 0; i &#60; height; i++) {
    board.append(makeRow(i));
  }
  return board;
}</pre>
      </div>
    </project-step>
    <project-step title="Show your hand">
      <p>Now that we've got our world made, let's decide how we're going to make the cells have their corresponding colors. We know all about style by class and style by ID, but those two are not ideal for this purpose. Style by ID is not ideal because the IDs for these cells should not change depending on what element is currently occupying it. Style by class is not ideal because these cells have some classes that we would like them to keep throughout (like <code>col-xs-1</code>), and sorting through them might be a bit of a pain. There are other solutions, however. One solution would be to apply the style inline right there in the draw function. Yet another approach, the one we will be using today, is style by attribute.</p>
      <p>We are going to define a new attribute for these cells that will describe what occupies it, and then we will apply the style depending on the value of that attribute. So, for this example, let's call this attribute "occupied".</p>
      <p>For organizational purposes, let's agree on a convention for how to assign values for this attribute. For reasons to be seen later (as part of the A students portion), let's agree that the value of the attribute will be the same as the value in the legend. So for example, if there is a strudel ("@") at this location in the grid, the "occupied" attribute for this position in our game board would be "Tiger" because that is the value associated with the strudel in our legend. Let's further agree that if the cell is empty, the "occupied" value will be "none".</p>
      <p>Great! So now that we've agreed on a convention, let's get the CSS in place. To style by an arbitrary attribute (like "occupied"), the general schema is</p>
      <pre>[attribute='value'] {
  style-property: desired-property-value;
  ...
}</pre>
      <p>So, in our particular case, the attribute we're trying to set is "occupied", and the first value we're going to set is, for instance, "Wall". Let's make all the walls black. You can test your code by entering the console, adding a gameboard grid to the document, then setting the "occupied" property for a specific cell in the grid. If you've set your CSS and "occupied" property correctly, you should see the desired effect.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>[occupied='Wall'] {
  background-color: black;
}

And to test your code, you can use
$('body').append(makeBoard(nameOfWorld));
$('#1-1').attr('occupied', 'Wall');</pre>
      <p>Great! Now let's set all the values. Be sure to include the empty spaces!</p>
    </project-step>
    <project-step title="Portraits">
    <p>Now that we've got our naming schema, let's start drawing out the board! To do this, we're probably going to want a method for our world that will edit the game board according to the current state of the world. So, let's make a new method for our World object called "draw" that takes a gameboard as its argument. It's important that the method takes the board as an argument rather than just editing it in place. The idea being that we know exactly what things are messing with what other things.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>World.prototype.draw = function(gameBoard) {
}</pre>
      <p>Now, much like the <code>toString</code> method in our World object, our <code>draw</code> method should probalby go one by one through our grid and update each element with the corresponding value from the World object according to our previously defined schema (in the last step). Be careful though. For reasons we'll go into later we can't just set it to be the value of the legend. So we're going to have to hand code each of these symbols with <code>if</code> statements. Go ahead and set up that loop now.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>for (var y = 0; y &#60; this.grid.height; y++) {
  for (var x = 0; x &#60; this.grid.width; x++) {
    var cell = gameBoard.find("#" + y + "-" + x);
    var element = this.grid.get(new Vector(x, y));
    var elemChar = charFromElement(element);
    if (elemChar == "@") {
      cell.attr("occupied", "Tiger");
    } else if (elemChar == "*") {
    ...
    }... {
    } else 
      cell.attr("occupied", "none");
  }
}</pre>
    </project-step>
    <project-step title="Animate Part II: The Revenge of the Scope" last="true">
      <p>Now we'd like to get rolling with it, but our <code>draw</code> method requires the game board to be given as an argument and our game board is not within the scope of our <code>animateWorld</code> function. Basically, we can't call our <code>draw</code> method from within the <code>animateWorld</code> function as we currently have it! To amend this, let's add the game board as a second argument and call the <code>draw</code> function while we're at it.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>function animateWorld(world, gameBoard) {
  setTimeout( function() {
    world.turn();
    world.draw(gameBoard);
    console.log(world.toString());
    animateWorld(world, gameBoard);
  }, 500);
}</pre>
      <p>Great! Now let's bring it all together! Let's write a function that runs our world. It should take as arguments a world and a container in which to put the world. It should then build the board, display that board in the container, draw the world onto the board, and animate the world.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>function bootUp(world, container) {
  var gameBoard = makeBoard(world);
  container.html(gameBoard);
  world.draw(gameBoard);
  animateWorld(world, gameBoard);
}</pre>
      <p>We're done! All that's left is to call this last function and the game runs! If you want to make it a little cooler, you might want to add a click handler and some logic under the hood to pause and unpause the game on clicks. You can check out the rest of this project for some more cool stuff we can do with this.</p>
    </project-step>
    <project-step title="Splitting our strings">
      <p>Firstly, I don't much like the way our <code>draw</code> function assigns the "occupied" value. If we want to add more things to our legend, we have to edit this function too? How are we supposed to remember that 6 years from now when we're editing this code? It would be much better if we could somehow get just the name for these things without everything else.</p>
      <p>If we simply assign the element as the value, we're going to end up with the value being a function, which is not acceptable. We could convert the element to a string, and then assign that as the value; but then the value would be</p>
      <pre>"function Tiger() {
  this.energy = ...
  ...
}"</pre>
      <p>which is obviously not what we want. We want just the name (in this case, "Tiger"), which we can extract from this string. To do this, we note that the next non-space character after the name we want is "(". So, let's take that string and split it at all "(" and take only the first one. For purposes of clarity, let's assume that we've stored the above string in a variable named <code>longString</code>.</p>
      <pre>longString.split("(");
==> ["function Tiger", ") {......"]</pre>
      <p>We can see that we're going to want only the first one there, so let's take just the first one. So far we've got, <code>longString.split('(')[0]</code> which evaluates to <code>"function Tiger"</code> or <code>"function Tiger "</code> depending on whether or not we had a space before the parens.</p>
      <p>Next, let's split this at each space. Remember, when we split at spaces, it also removes all spaces (convenient in this case)...</p>
      <pre>longString.split('(')[0].split(' ');
==> ["function", "Tiger"]</pre>
      <p>And we want the second one there. Let's go ahead and write this as a function now. We're going to need our function to take a character and a legend, look up the constructor associated with this character, convert it to a string and take only the name part as we did above. Let's write that code now.</p>
      <pre class='hint blur'>function attrFromChar(legend, char) {
  return legend[char].toString().split('(')[0].split(' ')[1];
}</pre>
      <p>so instead of hand coding all of that redundant nonsense we had earlier, we can simply use</p>
      <pre>cell.attr("occupied",
          attrFromChar(this.legend,
                       charFromElement(element)));</pre>
